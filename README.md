## 🎯 Project Description
**BookBox** is a full-featured Rails application where users can:
- 📖 Browse & review books
- 🗂️ Organize personal reading lists
- 🔁 Lend books to other users
- 🧠 See tasks, mark progress, and share recommendations

With global admin content, personalized lists, and interactive UI features, BookBox delivers a secure, collaborative reading experience.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- 🔐 **Devise** for user accounts (sign up, login via email or autogenerated username, password resets, account deletion)
- ✨ Users can log in seamlessly with either email or username (autogenerated at sign-up, e.g., `j.doe_12345`)
- ⚙️ **Admin & Super-Admin roles**
- 🚫 Super-admin is protected from deletion or demotion
- ✅ Secure access controls (`before_action`) for task and book ownership
- 🔁 Forced password reset workflow (e.g., after admin-triggered resets)

---

## 🧩 Models & Relationships (7 Total)
- **User** – Auth with roles & relationships
- **Book** – Title, author, genre, Active Storage cover image
- **Genre** – Global, admin-defined taxonomy
- **Review** – One per user/book, with rating and comment
- **TaskCategory** – Global or personal labels, color-coded
- **ReadingTask** – User’s to-read item with priority, completion, and recommendation
- **Lending** – Tracks active and historical book loans between users

> ✅ All models have strong validations and scoped uniqueness constraints

## 🎨 Front-End Design

### 1 · Authentication & User Accounts

| Feature                              | Details                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Devise-based signup / login**      | Users register with **first name, last name, email, password**. A unique `username` is auto-generated on create (`firstInitialLastName_randomNumber`) and stored in the DB.     |
| **Role system**                      | `regular` (default), `admin`, and a protected `super_admin`. Roles drive authorisation checks throughout the controllers.                                                       |
| **First-name display**               | The nav-bar *Account* dropdown greets the current user by first name on every page.                                                                                             |
| **Self-service profile**             | Users can update their profile, change password, or **delete their own account**. Deleting cascades to destroy all Reading Tasks, Reviews, Task Categories, and uploaded media. |
| **Password recovery & forced reset** | Standard Devise reset flow + an admin “Reset Password” action that flags the user to change it on next login.                                                                   |

### 2 · Books (Catalogue)

| Feature               | Details                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Cover uploads**     | Books accept an optional JPEG/PNG cover via **Active Storage + Cloudinary** (auto-thumbnailed).                                                                                      |
| **Genre filter**      | Each Book belongs to one fixed **Genre** (e.g., Fantasy, Biography). Browsing `/books` shows pill buttons to filter by genre; query params keep the filter active across pagination. |
| **Select2 Quick-Add** | When adding a Reading Task, a live **Select2 dropdown** lets users search the catalogue (covers + titles) without leaving the form.                                                  |
| **Pagination**        | Large lists are paginated with Kaminari; query parameters preserved for genre/search filters.                                                                                        |

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create task**    | From any Book card or the “Add Task” page (`/reading_tasks/new`), pick a book, set **priority** (High/Medium/Low) and an optional **Task Category**.                                |
| **Read / update**  | `/reading_tasks` lists current tasks. Inline controls let users change priority, toggle **recommend** flag, move the task to a different Task Category, or open the full edit form. |
| **Mark complete**  | One-click “✓ Done” button calls `PATCH /reading_tasks/:id/mark_completed`, moves the task to `/reading_tasks/completed`, and applies a grey-out badge.                              |
| **Delete task**    | Trash-can icon triggers `DELETE /reading_tasks/:id`.                                                                                                                                |
| **Visual cues**    | Priority levels get color-coded Bootstrap badges; completed tasks appear greyed with a strikethrough title.                                                                         |
| **Completed view** | `/reading_tasks/completed` tab lists finished books with date completed and rating shortcut.                                                                                        |

---

### 4 · Task Categories (user-defined)

| Feature               | Details                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full CRUD**         | Users create personal categories (`/task_categories/new`), assign them colours, edit names/colours, and delete them. |
| **Scoped uniqueness** | Category name must be unique per-user; deletion is blocked if tasks are still linked (restrict with error).          |
| **Filtering**         | Task index can be filtered by Task Category via dropdown.                                                            |

---

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed seed data** | Ten canonical genres are pre-loaded by `db/seeds.rb` (Fantasy → Young Adult). They are **not editable via UI** to avoid orphaning books. |
| **Index & show**    | `/genres` lists all genres; `/genres/:id` shows a genre banner plus its book catalogue.                                                  |

---

### 6 · Reviews

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-per-user**         | Users can leave a **star rating (1-5) and a comment** on any book they have read; uniqueness validation prevents multiple reviews by the same user on the same book. |
| **Edit / delete**        | Inline “Edit” and “Delete” icons on the Book detail page; actions routed through nested resources `/books/:book_id/reviews`.                                         |
| **Average rating badge** | Each Book card shows a live average rating badge (filled stars + numeric value).                                                                                     |

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start a loan**        | Owner clicks “Lend” on a Book card, selects a borrower (auto-complete list of registered users). Creates a `Lending` record with `lent_at` timestamp. |
| **Return workflow**     | Borrower (or owner) clicks “Return” to stamp `returned_at`.                                                                                           |
| **Conflict prevention** | Validation blocks new loans if the book is already on loan (only attempts with `returned_at = nil` are checked).                                      |
| **Visual indicators**   | Loaned books show a “📚 Borrowed by <name>” ribbon and are disabled from further edits until returned. The book cover is grayed out.            |

| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### 9 · Global UX Features

---

### 10 · Data Integrity & Cleanup

* **Restrict-with-error** on Task Category deletion prevents losing linked tasks.
* **Database-level foreign-keys** on all `belongs_to` associations.
